### Quorum Based

### [auraluxuryblockchain](https://auraluxuryblockchain.com/solutions)
> The Platform uses Quorum permissioned blockchain technology at its core. Quorum maintains a common ledger that can
only be updated, block after block, by the network consensus that members provide. Each Brand Stack has to manage at least
two Quorum nodes and ensure their liveness.

This blockchain network is completed by the centralized applications part:

- Blockchain services
that allow the connection between the blockchain and other applications.

- Off-chain services
including APIs used to connect business services to the Platform.

- Front-end applications
for consumer facing interactions.
