- The Challenge: 100/100/0
100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030
    * How to understand the initial hourly synchronicity? (% of hours during which Microsoft’s data center source zero carbon electricity)
    * How to certify the hourly match and avoid double counting of energy?
    * How to integrate the granular certificates into the official Energy Certificates and calculate hourly CO2 for reporting?

datacenter’s hourly energy consumption with Eneco’s Dutch offshore wind.

- FlexiDAO’s software calculated the 24/7 synchronicity score of its PPA by matching energy production data and energy consumption data
- Granular hourly energy certificates were issued and registered on the blockchain to avoid double counting
- Obtained all the energy certificates (Gos) needed to submit the yearly Scope 2 reporting
- Calculated the location-based and market-based CO2 emissions hour-by-hour in line with the GHG Protocol
