The Challenge
Like all green hydrogen producers, Acciona Energia finds it difficult to prove that the hydrogen it is producing is in fact fully renewable. The EU is increasingly looking towards solutions for renewable fuels certification, as it attempts to clamp down on carbon emissions. This lack of verification is a concern for investors, who want to be assured of the type of electricity consumed. Acciona has turned to FlexiDAO to help provide the highest form of credible hydrogen certification, in a bid to increase transparency.


The Solution
GreenH2chain® by Acciona, a technological solution developed by FlexiDAO to allow renewable hydrogen consumers to quantify, record, and monitor the decarbonisation process of their own energy supply. In addition, the solution provides all the necessary information on hydrogen consumption itself as well as data for calculating the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that consumers avoid by using this type of green energy

The Benefits
ACCIONA's customers are given access to a digital platform that allows them to verify and visualize the entire green hydrogen value chain in real-time and from anywhere in the world.
It allows renewable hydrogen consumers to quantify, record and monitor the decarbonization process of their own energy supply.
The software provides data for calculating the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that consumers avoid by using this type of green energy.

The Challenge
Energy off-takers, with which ACCIONA Energy had signed a PPA, were asking for a way to demonstrate that their energy consumption is truly green. Aside from the fundamental difficulty of distinguishing clean from non-clean energy coming from the grid, Acciona was faced with the additional challenge of proving the renewable origin of the energy consumed by its clients.

The Solution
FlexiDAO proposed a solution based on blockchain to improve ACCIONA's processes. The concepts of immutability, auditability, and trust inherent in blockchain technology sparked the interest of ACCIONA. Five wind-power and hydropower facilities in Spain for four corporate clients in Portugal are being tracke


## Total Engrgies

The Challenge
The risk of being accused of little ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) commitment or even greenwashing is one of the main drivers which fosters the prioritization of the purchase of renewable energy from local sources with low environmental impact. Access to more granular energy data is obstructed by the process of collecting, consolidating and analyzing the data proceeding from distributed renewable energy sources and several consumption points. This translates into the need for sophisticated purchasing requirements that energy retailers cannot meet through the official certification mechanisms such as the GOs.

The Solution
FlexiDAO´s software solution sheds new light on the GOs scheme, providing the current green tariffs with near real-time tracking of green energy sourcing. This gives a unique value to the market by providing a better and improved underlying technology infrastructure. The project developed between Total and FlexiDAO includes the registration and tracking through REspring of:

34 Generation Assets (Wind power and Solar PV) in France
 6 Customer’s of Total 
11 Consumption points.


## Eneco

The Challenge
Monitor and certify that the electricity consumed by district heating powered by Eneco is clean every hour of the day, 24/7, in sync with current EU - and Dutch - renewable energy certification schemes and EnergyTag guidelines

The Solution
FlexiDAO’s blockchain-based software creates a digital link to monitor, on an hourly basis, the production and consumption of Eneco’s offshore wind farm and Eneco’s electrode boiler connected to The Hague’s Ypenburg district heating network - all supported by measurement data made available by Eneco. CertiQ is legally responsible for certifying electricity and renewable heat.
