# Gas Fee

## Ethereum Gas Fee

> Gas is the amount of crypto that's paid to nodes on the blockchain to process a transaction. 

For Ethereum, gas is measured in gwei (1 gwei = 0.000000001 ether). Visit What Is Ethereum? if you need a recap on how Ethereum works.

How much gas you pay depends on:

Network congestion: Gas is higher if many people are trying to get their transactions in.
Transaction type: Gas is higher if your transaction is complex (e.g., minting an NFT vs. sending crypto to another wallet).
