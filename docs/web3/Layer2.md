# Layer 2

Ethereum L2 chains offer faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum L1.

## What are L2 chains?

> Letâ€™s start with a few definitions:

Layer 1 chain is the main Ethereum blockchain. Other non-ETH L1 chains include Solana, Avalanche, and Terra.
Layer 2 chain process transactions off-chain before bundling and submitting them to Ethereum L1. Examples include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Loopring. 
Sidechains are separate blockchains with their own gas token. Polygon is the most popular sidechain.
