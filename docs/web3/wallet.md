## Hot wallet

> A crypto wallet stores two keys:

A public key links to an address that lets you make transactions.
A private key proves that you own the assets with your address.
A seed phrase is 12-24 words that lets you access your private key.

> If your wallet was your bank account, your public key would be your account number and your private key would be your pin number. Of course, in web3, your assets are on the blockchain vs. in a bank. Just remember that:

You can share your public key with others to make transactions.
You must never share your private key or seed phrase with anyone.
