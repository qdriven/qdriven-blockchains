# Web3 Intro

## What is Web3? 什么是Web3

```
Crypto has one feature that has never existed before - trust. - Ben Horowitz

Why does Web3 Matter? Web3为什么重要？

- 不需要依赖中间人
  * Trust Bank
  * Trust Lawyers
  * Trust Social Networks
- 信任来自于ownership
  * not your key, not your coin

Web3 matters because we're building an internet owned by people instead of middlemen.
It's still early for web3 - there are scammers that undermine this trust and ownership narrative. That's why it's important to get educated early.

## Difference Between Web1,Web2,Web3

- Web1: Read
- Web2: Read, write
- Web3: Read, write, own

Web1 (1990-early 2000s) was read-only. People consumed static webpages that they navigated to from directories like Yahoo. Web1 was built on open-source protocols like HTTP.

Web2 (early 2000s-today) is read and write. People create and consume content on the social platforms that we're all familiar with. In web2, tech giants extract value from users by sitting in the middle. Web2 is built on client-server architecture where users are the client, and companies control the servers. 

Web3 (2020+) is read, write, and own.  People create, consume, and own the upside of their work through tokens. Web3 is built on peer-to-peer networks of computers that talk to each other without middlemen.

## What is a Token?

Tokens can be fungible or non-fungible:

- Fungible tokens are interchangeable (e.g., the US dollar, bitcoin).
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique (e.g., a piece of art).

以上描述都是一个理想化的状态，token只是一个代表拥有权的代表符号，这和数字时代是相符合的。
但是token的定价充满了不确定性和波动性，是一个充满争议的话题。同时目前也没有一个完善的说法可以支持token的定价问题。
